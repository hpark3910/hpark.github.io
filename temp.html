		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<blockquote>
		<em>
			Code, Cook, and Travel
		</em>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Iâ€™m a graduate student who is passionate about applying machine learning to various real world problems. My most recent app applies <em>nonnegative matrix factorization</em> to datasets for <strong>topic modeling</strong>. Right now, I am working on building a web app, which analyzes and lists trending youtube topics and videos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beside coding, I love cooking and traveling. I always try to cook at least one time a day with fresh ingredients. Also, I am passionate about learning and tasting different wines and cheeses.
		</p> 
		<p>
			I also love to travel. I have been to South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Hungary, Checz Republic, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. I am looking forward to visit all the continents in the future!

		<h1>Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</h1>
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization">
		<p>
			<em>
				"<dfn>Non-negative matrix factorization</dfn> is a group of algorithms in multivariate analysis and linear algebra where a matrix V is factorized into two matrices W and H, with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements." 
			</em> 
			from Wikipedia

		<p>
			Because of its nonnegativity, <abbr title="nonnegative matrix factorization">NMF</abbr> has proven to be successful in various fields including computer vision, recommendation systems, topic modeling, and audio signal processing.
