			Code, Cook, and Travel

		<p>
			Iâ€™m a graduate student who is passionate about applying machine learning to various real world problems. My most recent app applies <em>nonnegative matrix factorization</em> to datasets for <strong>topic modeling</strong>. Right now, I am working on building a web app, which analyzes and lists trending youtube topics and videos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beside coding, I love cooking and traveling. I always try to cook at least one time a day with fresh ingredients. Also, I am passionate about learning and tasting different wines and cheeses. So far, I have been to South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Hungary, Checz Republic, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. I am looking forward to visit all the continents in the future!
